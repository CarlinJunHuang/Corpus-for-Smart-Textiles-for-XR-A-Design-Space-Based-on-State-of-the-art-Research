# ISMAR 2024 Smart Textiles for XR: A Design Space Based on State-of-the-art Research

## Abstract
This repository contains supplemental corpus for the paper "Smart Textiles for XR: A Design Space Based on State-of-the-art Research".
Key highlights include:
- Structured framework for design, interaction, and application of smart textiles in XR.
- Discussion on two design cases: a smart pillow for VR social interaction and textile keyboard sleeves for AR typing.
- Emphasis on the potential to innovate smart textile solutions for an immersive digital-physical blend.

## Repository Content
- `Corpus.xlsx` - The complete dataset used for the scoping review.

| A Data Glove with Tactile Feedback for fMRI of Brain Activity | Jeonghun Ku, et al. | 2003 | J | CYBERPSYCHOLOGY & BEHAVIOR | Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. | - | HCI | Quantitative | VR | Gloves | Hands | Touch interaction | - | Touch | Virtual Reality Experiment | To design and validate an fMRI-compatible data glove with tactile feedback for studying brain activity during touch-based tasks. | The tactile data glove enhances the realism of VR environments and provides valuable data for fMRI studies on sensory processing. | The paper presents the design and validation of a data glove that enables tactile feedback in virtual environments to facilitate studies on brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The glove's sensors and tactile feedback mechanisms are designed to be compatible with MRI equipment, allowing researchers to capture detailed neural responses to tactile stimuli in VR settings. | fMRI - functional magnetic resonance imaging |
